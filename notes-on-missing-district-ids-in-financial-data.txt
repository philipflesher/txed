Education Service Center - 20 regions total
RESOLUTION: Let's remove these from the financials for all years.


2005 - 2013
District 227905 not in districts_by_xid. Skipping.
District 227906 not in districts_by_xid. Skipping.
Texas School for the Blind & Visually Impaired
Texas School for the Deaf
Why are these reported in the financials but not in the TEA performance stats?
RESOLUTION: Let's remove these from the financials for all years.


2006
District 057920 not in districts_by_xid. Skipping.
Wilmer Hutchins ISD in Dallas was shut down by the state for poor performance in summer 2005. So it's strange that there's financial data for 2005-2006.

2009
District 061803 not in districts_by_xid. Skipping.
Legends Academy in Denton
Not in the list of districts (financial) for 2009. But does exist for 2010-2012, which matches the school years that the school was actually in service:
http://www.dentonrc.com/local-news/local-news-headlines/20120601-funding-shortage-shutters-the-legends-academy.ece
So did all of this school's financial units get shifted one year backward (2009-2011)?


2010
District 123807 not in districts_by_xid. Skipping.
Bob Hope School in Port Arthur started in the 2009-2010 school year. But no data was reported for school performance by the TEA for the 2010 year.


2011
District 101865 not in districts_by_xid. Skipping.
Victory Prep in Houston. Hard to tell when this was started, but there are references on its Facebook page to 2010. There's financial data for 2010-2011. Why is there no performance data reported by TEA for 2010-2011?


2013
District 042906 not in districts_by_xid. Skipping.
Novice ISD closed after the 2012 school year. There are financial units for it for 2012-2013, but nothing in the accounts file - so this one should be safe to simply skip.

RESOLUTION: Skip this.
